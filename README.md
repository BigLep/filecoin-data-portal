# :abacus: Filecoin Data Portal

Local first data hub for Filecoin, built on top of the open data stack.

The repository contains code and artifacts to help process Filecoin data from on-chain and off-chain sources. It is a simplified version of [Datadex](https://github.com/davidgasquez/datadex) allowing you to:

- See the generated dashboards and reports at [Filecoin Data Portal](https://davidgasquez.github.io/filecoin-data-portal/).
- Collaborate on [core Filecoin models](https://github.com/davidgasquez/filecoin-data-portal/blob/main/dbt/models/filecoin_state_market_deals.sql).
- Share [Filecoin related explorations with the world](https://davidgasquez.github.io/filecoin-data-portal/reports/2023-06-14-Filecoin%20JSON-RPC.html)!
